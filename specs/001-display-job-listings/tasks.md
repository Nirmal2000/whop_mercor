## Phase 4: User Story 2 ‚Äì Review Full Job Detail (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Job seekers open a sidecar overlay with complete listing information while maintaining list scroll position.

**Goal**: Users paginate through listings, maintain state, and see accurate analytics context.

**Independent Test**: Changing page updates cards, reflects current/total indicators, persists selection on reload, and analytics events include page context.

- [X] T035 [P] [US4] Add Playwright pagination coverage in `tests/e2e/listings-pagination.spec.ts`.
- [X] T036 [P] [US4] Extend listings query helper for pagination inputs/outputs in `lib/supabase/listings.ts`.
- [X] T037 [US4] Update listings API to accept page parameters and return pagination metadata in `app/api/listings/route.ts`.
- [X] T038 [P] [US4] Build pagination controls component with responsive layout in `components/listings/PaginationControls.tsx`.

**Independent Test**: Initiate refresh from the admin dashboard, observe Supabase job table truncate/repopulate atomically, and confirm refreshed listings render publicly.

- [X] T044 [US5] Create Supabase migration for `job_listings` schema, `listings` table, indexes, and grants in `supabase/migrations/002_create_job_listings_schema.sql`.
- [X] T045 [P] [US5] Implement Mercor HTTP client and flattening logic in `lib/ingestion/mercor-client.ts`.
- [X] T046 [US5] Build transactional sync routine that truncates then upserts records in `lib/ingestion/sync-listings.ts`.
- [X] T047 [US5] Expose admin-only refresh API at `app/api/admin/listings/refresh/route.ts` with concurrency lock and status responses.
- [X] T048 [P] [US5] Add ‚ÄúRefresh Listings‚Äù control with progress states to `app/dashboard/[companyId]/listings/page.tsx`.
- [X] T049 [US5] Provide CLI/Edge trigger script in `scripts/refresh-listings.ts` and document usage in `docs/analytics-dashboard.md`.
- [X] T050 [P] [US5] Write Jest integration test for sync routine (`tests/unit/ingestion.spec.ts`) and Playwright flow for admin-triggered refresh (`tests/e2e/ingestion-refresh.spec.ts`).

**Checkpoint**: Admin refresh fully replaces Supabase dataset, exposes status, and keeps public UI in sync.

## Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Final hardening, documentation, and operational readiness.

- [X] T041 [P] Add rate limiting and structured logging to analytics event handler in `app/api/analytics/events/route.ts`.
- [X] T042 [P] Document analytics dashboard usage and cron setup in `docs/analytics-dashboard.md`.
- [X] T043 Update `package.json` scripts to include `seed:listings`, `aggregate:metrics`, and CI test commands.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- **Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2**: Setup must precede foundational infrastructure.
- **Phase 2 ‚Üí User Stories**: All user stories depend on foundational utilities, migrations, and tooling.
- **User Story Ordering**: Recommended sequence US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4 (priority order). US3 depends on analytics events from US1/US2; US4 enhances existing flows but can start once US1 data pipeline exists.
- **Polish Phase**: Runs after desired user stories are complete.

### Parallel Opportunities

- Tasks marked `[P]` within a phase touch different files and can proceed concurrently (e.g., T002 with T003, T012 with T014, T020 with T022).
- Different user stories can be staffed in parallel **after** Phase 2, provided shared files (e.g., `lib/supabase/listings.ts`) coordinate via sequencing.
- Testing tasks (e.g., Playwright specs) can run alongside implementation as they reference separate files.

---

## Implementation Strategy

- **MVP Focus**: Complete Phases 1‚Äì3 to deliver the browsing experience with analytics capture for card views.
- **Incremental Delivery**: Layer US2 for overlay details, US3 for analytics insight, US4 for advanced navigation, then US5 for ingestion and refresh controls.
- **Operational Readiness**: Finish with Phase 8 to harden observability and document ongoing operations (cron jobs, ingestion scripts).

---

## Task Metrics

- **Total Tasks**: 50
- **Per User Story**: US1 (8), US2 (8), US3 (8), US4 (6), US5 (7) ‚Äî remaining 13 cover setup, foundational, and polish.
- **Parallel Opportunities Identified**: 21 tasks flagged `[P]`.
- **Independent Test Criteria**:
  - US1: Listings render with fallback data states.
  - US2: Overlay displays full details without losing scroll position.
  - US3: Admin-only dashboard surfaces accurate metrics; non-admin blocked.
  - US4: Pagination preserves state and analytics include context.
  - US5: Refresh replaces Supabase dataset atomically and exposes status to admins.
- **Suggested MVP Scope**: Complete through Phase 3 (User Story 1) plus foundational infrastructure.
