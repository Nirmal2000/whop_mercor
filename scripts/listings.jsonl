That’s why we’re building a pod of AI Red-Teamers: human data experts who probe AI models with adversarial inputs, surface vulnerabilities, and generate the red-team data that makes AI safer for our customers.\n\nThis role may include reviewing AI outputs that touch on sensitive topics such as bias, misinformation, or harmful behaviors. All work is text-based, and participation in higher-sensitivity projects is optional and supported by clear guidelines and wellness resources.\n\n### What You’ll Do\n\n- Red-team AI models and agents: jailbreaks, prompt injections, misuse cases, exploits\n    \n- Generate high-quality human data: annotate failures, classify vulnerabilities, and flag systemic risks\n    \n- Apply structure: follow taxonomies, benchmarks, and playbooks to keep testing consistent\n    Document reproducibly: produce reports, datasets, and attack cases customers can act on\n    \n- Flex across projects: support different customers, from LLM jailbreaks to socio-technical abuse testing\n    \n\n### Who You Are\n\n- You bring prior red-teaming experience (AI adversarial work, cybersecurity, socio-technical probing)\n    \n- You’re curious and adversarial: you instinctively push systems to breaking points\n    \n- You’re structured: you use frameworks or benchmarks, not just random hacks\n    \n- You’re communicative: you explain risks clearly to technical and non-technical stakeholders\n    \n- You’re adaptable: thrive on moving across projects and customers\n    \n\n### Nice-to-Have Specialties\n\n- Adversarial ML: jailbreak datasets, prompt injection, RLHF/DPO attacks, model extraction\n    \n- Cybersecurity: penetration testing, exploit development, reverse engineering\n    \n- Socio-technical risk: harassment/disinfo probing, abuse analysis\n    \n- Creative probing: psychology, acting, writing for unconventional adversarial thinking\n    \n\n### What Success Looks Like\n\n- You uncover vulnerabilities automated tests miss\n    \n- You deliver reproducible artifacts that strengthen customer AI systems\n    \n- Evaluation coverage expands: more scenarios tested, fewer surprises in production\n    \n- Mercor customers trust the safety of their AI because you’ve already probed it like an adversary\n    \n\n### Why Join Mercor\n\n- Build experience in human data-driven AI red-teaming at the frontier of safety\n    \n- Play a direct role in making AI systems more robust, safe, and trustworthy\n    \n\n### About Mercor\n\nMercor is a talent marketplace that connects top experts with leading AI labs and research organizations.\n\nOur investors include Benchmark, General Catalyst, Adam D’Angelo, Larry Summers, and Jack Dorsey.\n\nThousands of professionals across law, engineering, research, and creative fields collaborate with Mercor on frontier AI projects shaping the future.\n\n**The pay rate for this role may vary by project, customer, and content category.

You’ll own everything from networking events, hackathons, and large-scale summits, starting in the U.S. and expanding worldwide. This is a highly cross-functional, external-facing role for a builder who loves operations, community, and the craft of high-caliber experiences.\n\n**What you’ll do**\n\n- Own the end-to-end events engine: strategy, budgets, timelines, venues, vendor/AV, run-of-show, contingency plans, and post-mortems.\n    \n- Program design: craft formats for different expert segments (ex. clinicians vs. AI researchers vs. legal specialists).\n    \n- Community building at scale: create playbooks, host kits, and an ambassador program that empowers experts to run meetups under Mercor’s brand.\n    \n- Marketing and growth: drive audience development, landing pages, email/SMS, social, partnerships, and press opportunities to fill rooms with the right audience.\n    \n- Content and storytelling: recruit speakers, moderate sessions, and turn events into reusable content — highlight reels, quotes, and case studies.\n    \n- Cross-functional collaboration: partner with Product and Engineering on demos and launches, and with our Events lead and Ops on logistics and scale.\n    \n- Partner ecosystem: build relationships with universities, professional societies, conferences, and labs for co-hosted programming.\n    \n\n**About you**\n\n- Operator at heart: you’ve run complex, large-scale events and can move from venue contracts to speaker prep without dropping details.\n    \n- Community-first: high EQ, excellent communication, comfortable on stage and one-to-one.\n    \n- Tech and AI fluent: experience in a technology environment and up-to-date on AI trends.\n    \n- Marketing savvy: hands-on with campaign planning, social media marketing, and brand consistency.\n    \n- Analytical: you define success up front, track metrics, and iterate based on data.\n    \n- Self-starter: you’ve built something from zero — a company, a club, a conference, or a creator community.\n    \n- Education: Bachelor’s degree preferred. Top-tier university a plus; or a degree in Business, Economics, Advertising, Marketing Analytics, or similar.\n    \n\n**Bonus points**\n\n- Experience engaging professional audiences like physicians, lawyers, researchers, or senior engineers or academia like PhD and Master’s students. \n    \n- An existing online or IRL audience.\n    \n- Comfortable on stage or on camera.\n    \n- Familiarity with tools like Circle, Airtable, Notion, Figma, Eventbrite/Luma/Splash, HubSpot/Marketo, and dashboarding tools.", "detail_referralBoost": false, "detail_createdAt": "2025-10-17T22:06:23Z", "detail_isMostRecent": true, "detail_computedExplorePageVisibility": true, "detail_computedExplorePageVisibilityReason": "", "detail_offersEquity": true, "detail_companyName": null, "companyId": "0385ca0a-d220-47a9-85dd-b458c99f673f", "companyWebsite": null, "newCandidateCount": null, "recentWeekCandidateCount": 271, "availableSpots": null, "rejectionTemplateSubject": "An Update To Your Community Manager Application", "rejectionTemplateBody": "Hi {{first\\_name}},\n\nThank you for applying to the {{listing\\_name}} position through Mercor.\n\nUnfortunately, after reviewing your application, the hiring manager decided not to move forward at this time.\n\nIf circumstances change or we find another opportunity that aligns with your profile, we'll be sure to reach out.
